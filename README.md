# Crypto Clustering Analysis

## Overview
This analysis focuses on clustering cryptocurrencies based on key metrics such as price, market capitalization, trading volume, and volatility. By utilizing machine learning techniques, specifically K-means clustering, the goal was to group cryptocurrencies with similar characteristics, offering insights into market behavior. These insights are intended to guide investors, traders, and analysts in understanding cryptocurrency trends, identifying potential investment opportunities, and evaluating market risks.

## Techniques & Tools Used
**Data Preprocessing:** **Pandas** was used to clean the dataset, handling missing values and outliers. Data was transformed and scaled using **StandardScaler** to ensure fair comparisons between cryptocurrencies.

**Clustering Algorithm:**
- **K-means clustering** was implemented to group cryptocurrencies into clusters based on similarities across multiple features such as market cap, price, and volatility.
- The optimal number of clusters was determined using the **Elbow Method** and **Silhouette Score**, ensuring that the clusters were both meaningful and interpretable.

**Demensionality Reduction:** **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** was used to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, visualizing the clusters in two dimensions while retaining key variance across features.

**Data Visualization:** **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** were used to create visual representations of the clusters, such as scatter plots and heatmaps, which helped in interpreting the data patterns.

## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning**

The initial dataset contained missing values and extreme outliers, which were addressed by imputing missing data where possible and removing outliers that could impact the integrity of the clustering results.

2. **Feature Engineering**

Relevant features, including price, market cap, and trading volume, were selected and scaled. 

3. **K-means Clustering**

After scaling the features, K-means clustering was applied to group cryptocurrencies. The Elbow Method was used to determine the number of clusters, with the aim of balancing between simplicity and complexity.

Each cryptocurrency was assigned to a specific cluster, representing similar behavior and traits.

4. **PCA Visualization**

To simplify the interpretation of high-dimensional clustering results, PCA was employed to reduce the dataset to two dimensions. This enabled easy visualization of the clusters on a 2D scatter plot, showing how cryptocurrencies with similar features grouped together.
